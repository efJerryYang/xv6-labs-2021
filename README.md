# Xv6 Labs 2021

Welcome to my personal clone of the 2021 labs for the Operating System Engineering course (6.S081) at MIT. It is important to ensure that your running environment meets the requirements outlined in the [Operating System Engineering course materials](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/xv6.html).

Below is an update on the progress of the labs (note: labs from the 2020 version of the course that have been completed have not yet been moved to this repository):

- [ ] `util`
- [ ] `syscall`
- [ ] `pgtbl`
- [x] `traps`
- [ ] `cow`: `cowtest` passed, `usertests` failed (`copyout` and `pgbug`)
- [x] `thread`
- [ ] `net`
- [ ] `lock`
- [x] `fs`
- [ ] `mmap`

Please note that the `main` branch of this repository only contains updated code and necessary resources for display. If you are looking for the complete code for a specific lab, you will need to switch to the corresponding branch.
